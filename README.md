For the last 4 years or so, I've kept a text file on my desktop that contains what I considered to be a list of helpful snippets of code for my Python and especially PAGE programming projects.  It's been helpful to me and I use it at least 4 times a week.

This has grown overtime from just some Tkinter/Python code snippets for things like setting up bindings and callbacks for Listbox widgets and Comboboxe widgets to functions that handle things like setting the cursor to and from a busy cursor when things will probably take some time to overriding the tab colours for the TNotebook widget. 

During the later part of December of 2023, I thought that I would create a quick and dirty database system that could be queried to find the snippets quicker than scrolling through the text file or ever doing a search using <Ctrl> + F in the text editor.  December, was a bit slow for me since my work with Don Rozenberg on PAGE 8.0 was winding down toward a release, so I got started creating the database and prototype GUI using PAGE 8.0 development release.  This allowed me to do some deeper testing on PAGE to make sure that I couldn't break PAGE any further and get the ball rolling.

On January 1 2024, Don released PAGE 8.0 to the public ( [PAGE download | SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/)) and both Don and I decided to take a few weeks off from active development and deal with things that we've been putting off to make sure that PAGE 8.0 got released.  This gave me the perfect reason to get back to the development of this program.

There is a TONNE of things left to do before anyone, including myself, can use, the database program in any meaningful way.  There are many more snippets (probably close to 100+) to add, the ability to edit and update existing snippet entries, documentation to create and compile (using sphinx), and general cleanup and debugging to be done before I would even consider creating a beta release.  However, I wanted to create the repository and get the initial upload done before I actually needed it.  So that's why the repository is here so early.

More information to come as I get things working better and get some of my "wishlist" features, bug fixes and code cleanup done.

Once again, please, don't use this in anything other that to see this as anything other than a learning experience.
